E-commerce is the general term for online sales of products or services. E-commerce, in its most basic form, is the electronic transmission of money and data between two or more parties. Since its birth in the 1960s with electronic data interchange and the advent of online purchasing in the 1990s, this type of business has undergone significant evolution.
